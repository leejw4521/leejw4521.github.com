Last week I went to see the animated movie [Demon Slayer][cgv] To a nearby movie theater. I found it quite entertaining even though I've never seen that anime before.

Since it recently took first place in advance ticket sales, if you don't have any movies to watch these days, I highly recommend going to see the movie [Demon Slayer][cgv] even if you haven't seen it before.

If you're interested, check out the [Demon Slayer][cgv] website for more info.
