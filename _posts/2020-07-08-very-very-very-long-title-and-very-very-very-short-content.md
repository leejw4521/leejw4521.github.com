Today, I will be creating a cmd that I was given as homework. CMD is the command prompt on our computer, and we're going to make it in Python.
Since I can't include all of cmd's features, I'm going to try to create just a few, a total of four.
1. cd **foldername**
2. cd..
3. dir
4. cat **filename**


So if I try to write code with these features...
