I'm writing on my blog after a long time. Since the first post was in a diary format, I thought I should write the next one about coding, but I don't have anything to write about yet. I went to my grandmother's house during Thanksgiving. It was nice to eat a lot of delicious food and see my relatives. I spent almost all my time working, but it was fun. And I came home and held a Ancestral Rites. I kept doing it, so my body remembered it. That's it for today. Next time, I'll try to write a post about coding!
